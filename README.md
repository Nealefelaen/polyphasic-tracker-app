# Polyphasic Tracker App

This is a thrown together PhoneGap app for polyphasic.net/discord, adapted from
the PhoneGap Hello World app (so if you see references to that, that's why).
All code so far is in www/index.html (javascript at the bottom of index.html).

Clean-up of the code could probably be done, and the design is pretty basic.

Design guidelines:
1. [Done] Schedule selection and start date entry
2. [In Progress] Cognitive performance tests (at least reaction time and working memory)
3. [Not Done] Optional weekly test reminders (as notifications/alarms, with custom time and a midday default)
4. [Done] Checkbox style adaptation sign entry (with criteria shown)
5. [Not Done] Data export
